# py-meteor
py-meteor shows examples for different format weather data reading, writing, and plotting

## Motivation
Although many weather data are free to use in public, to process different kinds of weather data is a headache.  There are many different formats: .grib & .nc for operational data, .hdf for satellite data, .txt for stational data, and .json for api data etc.  Thus, this project shows python example codes for developers and analysts to use as a shorthand.

## Installation
### Required libraries
* matplotlib
* basemap or cartopy
